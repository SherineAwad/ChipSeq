## Analysis of ChipSeq data


We analysed Chipseq data for Series GSE181251; ex vivo electroporation was used to overexpress human homologues of NFIA/B/X in E14 retina
The pipeline used macs for calling the peaks, HOMER for annotating the peaks and Motif enrichment, and chipSeeker for pathway analysis and plots
